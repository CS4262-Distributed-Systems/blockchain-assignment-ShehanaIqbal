# Concepts that I learnt about blockchains

1. Blockchain is a decentralized network of records which ensures that the transactions are authorized by most number of nodes. This makes the blockchain network very reliable and transparent. The records cannot be changed without unless most nodes in the network agrees to.

2. There is no single authority. All the nodes in the network have equal rights on what should be on the network. This is why huge blockchains network like etherium are considered to be highly reliable and powerful. Everyone trusts these blockchain networks because of its transparency.
